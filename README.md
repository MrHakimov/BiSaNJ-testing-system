Testing system based on [Ejudge](https://ejudge.ru/)

I participated at a lot of domestic (Tajikistan) coding competitions and some international olympiads also (IOIP - ITMO, OOIU - Innopolis, etc.).

International olympiads which I participated in were organized very well. Usually, domestic olympiads are not so. At least, they do not use testing systems (no Polygon, no online-judges, no Ejudge), which is very ineffective. I remember, we were starting to solve tasks early in the morning and finishing to check all of the solutions late at night. I concede, that it was amazing pastime. By the way, organizers did not use Polygon or vjudge.net, for example, because of the Internet (it is still not available everywhere in Tajikistan), I think, or difference in knowledge of students from big cities and from villages, maybe.

I think that it is a problem and should be solved. So, when I was at 11th grade at school I decided to build testing system, which could work without the use of the Internet. I started searching, and then I found `Ejudge`. I read a lot of documentation on how to install system, how to organize contests, etc.. Finally, when I learned the basic things, I started to build this machine :)

I downloaded version for Virtual Box (Fedora), and I had a lot of issues, because I never used `Linux` before, I never did this kind of work. I waste a lot of time (really, a huge amount), because there was nobody, who could help me, except my mentor - [Erkin Kholmatov](https://vk.com/e.kholmatov) (thanks for your belief, and exactly help). But, finally I managed to launch it and to run first contest in it. At the same time I was tutoring at algorithms and data structures club, which we organized (me, my brother and Erkin Kholmatov). I prepared my first contest (it took about two weeks or more) and tested machine in club. Happily, test was passed successfully.

Then I started to work on design, on language, on usability, in one word. It was available only in English and Russian languages, and I translated front-end part to Tajik, and worked at the design a little bit.

So now, system grew up, but it still works offline, in my school's server. I am planning to organize access to it from web, hope to do it soon.

Because of my another mentor - Husein Ochilov, machine is now working and developing! That's great.

Now all of the city-wide olympiads or coding competitions and some of the region-wide coding events are helding in `BiSaNJ`. We are planning to present `BiSaNJ` to republic-wide audience and held all domestic olympiads in it.
